## Learning Path Overview

### Phase 1: Monolithic Foundation (Weeks 1-8)
- Modern development practices
- Core domain implementation
- Data management and caching
- Event architecture foundation

### Phase 2: Enhancing the Monolith (Weeks 9-14)
- Modern API architecture
- Security architecture
- Performance engineering

### Phase 3: Transition to Microservices (Weeks 15-20)
- Service architecture
- Microservice extraction
- Observability and operations
